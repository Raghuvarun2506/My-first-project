<h1><font color="blue">Preventions of Smoking & Drinking</h1></font>
	
			
			<h2>Fact Sheet</h2><img src="images/b.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" align="right"><p class="a">This is the 31st tobacco-related Surgeon General’s report issued since 1964. It describes the epidemic of tobacco use among youth ages 12 through 17 and young adults ages 18 through 25, including the epidemiology, causes, and health effects of this tobacco use and interventions proven to prevent it. Scientific evidence contained in this report supports the following facts:</p><p>We have made progress in reducing tobacco use among youth; however, far too many young people are still using tobacco. Today, more than 600,000 middle school students and 3 million high school students smoke cigarettes. Rates of decline for cigarette smoking have slowed in the last decade and rates of decline for smokeless tobacco use have stalled completely.</p><ul><li>Every day, more than 1,200 people in this country die due to smoking. For each of those deaths, at least two youth or young adults become regular smokers each day. Almost 90% of those replacement smokers smoke their first cigarette by age 18.</li><li>There could be 3 million fewer young smokers today if success in reducing youth tobacco use that was made between 1997 and 2003 had been sustained.</li><li>Rates of smokeless tobacco use are no longer declining, and they appear to be increasing among some groups.</li><li>Cigars, especially cigarette-sized cigars, are popular with youth. One out of five high school males smokes cigars, and cigar use appears to be increasing among other groups.</li><li>Use of multiple tobacco products—including cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco—is common among young people.</li><li>Prevention efforts must focus on young adults ages 18 through 25, too. Almost no one starts smoking after age 25. Nearly 9 out of 10 smokers started smoking by age 18, and 99% started by age 26. Progression from occasional to daily smoking almost always occurs by age 26.</li></ul><p>Tobacco use by youth and young adults causes both immediate and long-term damage. One of the most serious health effects is nicotine addiction, which prolongs tobacco use and can lead to severe health consequences. The younger youth are when they start using tobacco, the more likely they’ll be addicted.</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>Early cardiovascular damage is seen in most young smokers; those most sensitive die very young.</li>
<li>Smoking reduces lung function and retards lung growth. Teens who smoke are not only short of breath today, they may end up as adults with lungs that will never grow to full capacity. Such damage is permanent and increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</li>
<li>Youth are sensitive to nicotine and can feel dependent earlier than adults. Because of nicotine addiction, about three out of four teen smokers end up smoking into adulthood, even if they intend to quit after a few years.</li>
<li>Among youth who persist in smoking, a third will die prematurely from smoking.</li></ul>
<img src="images/c1.jpg" height="250px" width="250" align="right">
<p class="a">Youth are vulnerable to social and environmental influences to use tobacco; messages and images that make tobacco use appealing to them are everywhere.</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>Young people want to fit in with their peers. Images in tobacco marketing make tobacco use look appealing to this age group.</li>
<li>Youth and young adults see smoking in their social circles, movies they watch, video games they play, websites they visit, and many communities where they live. Smoking is often portrayed as a social norm, and young people exposed to these images are more likely to smoke.</li>
<li>Youth identify with peers they see as social leaders and may imitate their behavior; those whose friends or siblings smoke are more likely to smoke.</li>
<li>Youth who are exposed to images of smoking in movies are more likely to smoke. Those who get the most exposure to onscreen smoking are about twice as likely to begin smoking as those who get the least exposure. Images of smoking in movies have declined over the past decade; however, in 2010 nearly a third of top-grossing movies produced for children—those with ratings of G, PG, or PG-13— contained images of smoking.</li></ul>
<p class="a">Tobacco companies spend more than a million dollars an hour in this country alone to market their products. This report concludes that tobacco product advertising and promotions still entice far too many young people to start using tobacco.</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>The tobacco industry has stated that its marketing only promotes brand choices among adult smokers. Regardless of intent, this marketing encourages underage youth to smoke. Nearly 9 out of 10 smokers start smoking by age 18, and more than 80% of underage smokers choose brands from among the top three most heavily advertised.</li>
<li>The more young people are exposed to cigarette advertising and promotional activities, the more likely they are to smoke. </li>
<li>The report finds that extensive use of price-reducing promotions has led to higher rates of tobacco use among young people than would have occurred in the absence of these promotions. </li>
<li>Many tobacco products on the market appeal to youth. Some cigarette-sized cigars contain candy and fruit flavoring, such as strawberry and grape. </li>
<li>Many of the newest smokeless tobacco products do not require users to spit, and others dissolve like mints; these products include snus—a spitless, dry snuff packaged in a small teabag-like sachet—and dissolvable strips and lozenges. Young people find these products appealing in part because they can be used without detection at school or other places where smoking is banned. However, these products cause and sustain nicotine addiction, and most youth who use them also smoke cigarettes.</li>
<li>Through the use of advertising and promotional activities, packaging, and product design, the tobacco industry encourages the myth that smoking makes you thin. This message is especially appealing to young girls. It is not true—teen smokers are not thinner than nonsmokers.</li></ul>
<p class="a">Comprehensive, sustained, multi-component programs can cut youth tobacco use in half in 6 years.</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>Prevention is critical. Successful multi-component programs prevent young people from starting to use tobacco in the first place and more than pay for themselves in lives and health care dollars saved.</li>
<li>Strategies that comprise successful comprehensive tobacco control programs include mass media campaigns, higher tobacco prices, smoke-free laws and policies, evidence-based school programs, and sustained community-wide efforts.</li>
<li>Comprehensive tobacco control programs are most effective when funding for them is sustained at levels recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</li></ul><br>

  <h1>Preventing Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism&mdash;<br>
    An Update</h1>
    
     <p class="a">Drinking too much alcohol can take a heavy toll, not only on a person&rsquos health but also on his or her family relationships and work or school performance. Alcohol consumption can lead to alcohol dependence and abuse, contribute to a number of diseases and mental and behavioral disorders, and may lead to a range of injuries. In addition, drinkers and their families are subject to social harm, such as family disruption, problems at the workplace (including unemployment), criminal convictions, and financial problems. They also encounter higher health care and related costs.<sup>1,2</sup> </p>
     <img src="images/D17.jpg" height="300" width="400" align="right">
<p class="a">Drinking produces immense costs to society in terms of health care expenses, lost productivity, and lost years of lives. One of the most effective ways to lessen the costs associated with alcohol abuse and alcoholism is to prevent people from starting abusive drinking patterns. Because people drink for different reasons and under a wide variety of circumstances, prevention efforts must address an array of problems associated with that breadth of drinking experience. </p>
     <p class="a">This <em>Alert</em> explores some of the most effective prevention approaches in use today, aimed at a variety of groups&mdash;especially youth, their families, and the communities in which they live and work. It reviews laws and policies that can curtail access to alcohol or curb its use, protecting society as a whole and reducing the social, legal, and monetary costs of alcohol abuse and dependence.</p>
     <h4> Costs of Alcohol Abuse </h4>
     <p class="a">High-risk drinking leads to considerable personal and societal 
       harm both in the United States and around the world. Globally, 
       for example, alcohol is the third-leading risk factor for premature death and disability.<sup>3,4</sup> The costs associated with alcohol use amount to 1 to 3 percent of the gross domestic product in high-income countries.<sup>1</sup> In the United States, the estimated costs of alcohol abuse were $223.5 billion in 2006.<sup>5</sup> Drinkers and their families pay only a portion; instead, nearly 60 percent of these costs fall to the government and others in society.<sup>5</sup> More than 
       70 percent of the total costs were attributed to lost productivity.<sup>6</sup></p>
     <p class="a"> In the United States, in 2007, roughly 9 percent of full-time workers overall reported heavy alcohol use (five or more drinks on the same occasion on 5 or more days in the past 30 days), and 30 percent reported binge drinking (i.e., consuming five or more drinks on the same occasion at least once in the past 30 days).<sup>7</sup> According to a national survey, this type of alcohol abuse causes absences from work, accidents, and worker productivity losses.<sup>8</sup> It is estimated that 15 percent of the U.S. workforce, or about 19.2 million workers, consume enough alcohol to lead to workplace impairment.<sup>8</sup></p>
     <p class="a"> In addition to the enormous impact of adult alcohol abuse, costs associated with the consequences of underage drinking 
       are estimated at $62 billion per year.<sup>9</sup></p>
 <img src="images/D1.jpg" height="200px" width="250px" align="left">    
<p class="a"> <strong><br> What Is High-Risk Drinking?</strong></p>
     <p class="a"> Sometimes simply knowing what risky drinking is can help people
 to recognize and curb their unhealthy drinking patterns. 
To better define high-risk and low-risk drinking, the National Institute on Alcohol
 Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed specific guidelines: 
Low-risk drinking is considered to be no more than 14 standard drinks
 per week (4 per day) for men and 7 standard drinks per week (3 per day) for women.
<sup>10</sup> By publicizing these low-risk drinking limits, NIAAA hopes to raise awareness
 of the risk for alcohol-related harm and to prevent some of the problems that result from risky drinking.<sup>11</sup></p>
     <h4> Targeted Prevention Approaches&mdash;What Works</h4>
     <p class="a"> When providing healthy-drinking guidelines is not enough to stop harmful drinking, a next step is to target specific groups with focused prevention messages.</p>
     <p class="a"> <strong><br>
       Prevention Programs for Youth</strong></p>
     <p class="a"> Alcohol remains the drug of choice among America&rsquo;s adolescents, with rates of current (i.e., past 30-day) use that are more than double those of cigarette smoking and rates of annual use that far exceed the use of marijuana and other illicit drugs.<sup>12,13</sup> Because drinking is so pervasive in this group, underage alcohol use has proven to be even more difficult to prevent than other drug use.<sup>12</sup> Providing young people with tools they can use, such as ways they can say no to drinking, and changing their family or community dynamics can help prevent or at least delay their alcohol use.<sup>14</sup></p>
     <p class="a"> <strong><br>
       School-Based Interventions</strong></p>
     <p class="a"> School is a chief part of most young people&rsquo;s lives and, as such, provides a critical setting for prevention and intervention efforts. Effective programs (see table 1) include elements that:<sup>12&ndash;16</sup></p>
     <ul class="a">
       <li> Correct the misperception that everybody is drinking.</li>
       <li> Teach youth ways to say no to alcohol.</li>
       <li> Use interactive teaching techniques (e.g., small-group activities, role plays, and same-age leaders).</li>
       <li> Involve parents and other segments of the community.</li>
       <li> Revisit the topic over the years to reinforce prevention messages.</li>
       <li> Provide training and support for teachers and students.</li>
       <li> Are culturally and developmentally on target for the students they serve.</li>
     </ul>
