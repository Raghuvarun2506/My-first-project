<li>Now a days our teen agers are more adicted to SMOKING & DRINKING</li>
<li>Govt has take stright rules to controle these teen agers adition over SMOKING & DRINKING</li>
<li>The effect of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on the disease activity and physical functioning in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is currently understated.</li>
<li>Information regarding smoking status (current, never) was collected at the time of enrollment, and pack-years of smoking served as the measure of cumulative exposure. Never smoking was defined as having smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in the subject’s lifetime. Information specific to ‘second-hand’, former smokers or other environmental smoking exposures were not collected as part of this study</li>
<li>Participants were asked to report their average frequency of consumption of specified foods and beverages during the previous 6 months. Despite of the separate items including beer, wine and liquor, participants who drink more than once a week were categorized as “alcohol drinker”, and those drink less than once a week or have no alcohol intake for more than 1 year were considered as non-drinking patients.</li>
<li>Descriptive statistics were used for assessing the parameters related to disease. The differences in terms of variables studied in patients who are grouped as experiencing high disease activity and low disease activity, according to the BASDAI, were evaluated with independent sample chi-square test. </li><li>The relations between smoking, alcohol consumption and the other evaluation parameters were examined with Mann-Whitney u test and analysis of variance. Hierarchic multiple regression analysis was chosen to analyze the contribution of demographic, smoking and alcohol consumption variables to BASDAI. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 17.0, and the level of significance was set at P < 0.05.</li> 
<li>To our knowledge, this study is for the first time to show the association of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption in Chinese AS patients. It is general acknowledged that the management of pain and functional disability are two most challengeable focuses in AS patients. All the therapeutic approaches available currently are mainly conducted for relieving the pain and preventing the disability of AS patients.</li>
<li>Heavy drinking AS patients scored remarkably higher in BASMI compared with non-drinkers (2.4 ± 2.4 vs. 1.6 ± 2.0). As it has been accepted that exercise is the foundation of rehabilitation for AS patients, while drinking reduces central nervous system activity and the impaired muscle strengthen prevents the progress of rehabilitation [40]. Moreover, lack of exercise makes one of the alcoholism-related lifestyle. Thus it has been presumed that heavy drinking patients were evaluated higher BASMI scores due to lack of exercise [41]. Our data revealed that heavy drinking AS patients were more likely to show functional disability.</li>
<li>Given that it's early in the New Year, now might be a good time to come up with a resolution to reduce your drinking, or stop smoking (or both). That is if you remember, of course.</li>
<li>Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and smoking cigarettes together could be having a negative impact on your memory. In fact, the impairment associated with using both of these substances is greater than the single use of either substance—a double whammy.</li></font>
